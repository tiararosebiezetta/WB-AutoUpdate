# WeebProject-AutoUpdate
Auto-update for WeebProject.<br>
## Notes
- Just restart your dyno and the latest commit of WeebProject will be pulled automatically.<br>
- Don't update your userbot via updater inside the userbot or the auto-update feature won't be there anymore.<br>
## Deploy
- Heroku suspends the deployment with one-click button of this repo within some hours after this repo was created, so figure it yourself, will ya? Their AI seems tough.
